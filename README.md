**To execute code, just run `./run.sh <MODE>` from the root of this folder in a terminal. `MODE` can take either of two values `full` or `dev`.** 

**GOTCHAS:** 
1. Be sure to make the run script executable if it's not already (it should be, but run `chmod +x ./run.sh` from the root of this folder from the terminal). 
2. Make sure to have a directory named `data` inside which there is `fulldata` and `devdata`.
